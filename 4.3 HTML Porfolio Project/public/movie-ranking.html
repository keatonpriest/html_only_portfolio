<h1>My Three Favorite Movies</h1>

<hr/>

<h2>Bottle Rocket</h2>
    <p>A comedy trio robbing for pity money. Beautiful coming of age story tbh.</p>

<h2>Call Me by Your Name</h2>
    <p>Absoulutly gorgeous of a film. Gay dudes in 80s Italy. La dolce vita!</p>

<h2>Phantom Thread</h2>
    <p>Daniel Day Lewis as tailor, and he plays Woodcock with such detail. A complex love story. A rich soundtrack.</p>
